# 🍕 **PizzaLava - The Ultimate Pizza Delivery Service**

Welcome to **PizzaLava**, the most delicious online pizza delivery service! Powered by Django and a blend of modern frameworks, PizzaLava is designed to deliver not just pizza but also a seamless and enjoyable user experience.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

PizzaLava is built with **Django** at its core, ensuring a solid, scalable, and secure foundation for the business. We’ve integrated a variety of popular frameworks and tools to enhance both the frontend and backend of the application:

- **Bootstrap 5** 🎨: For sleek, responsive designs.
- **jQuery** ⚙️: For dynamic interactions and seamless user experience.
- **FontAwesome** 💎: To provide beautiful icons and make the UI more intuitive.
- **Swiper.js** 🎥: For smooth, touch-friendly sliders.
- **PostgreSQL** 🗄️: Our reliable database solution.
- **Gunicorn** & **Nginx** 🌐: For production-ready deployment.

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/PizzaLava.git

### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment**

It's always a good idea to keep dependencies isolated. Set up a virtual environment:

```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

Next, install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. **Database Setup**

Apply migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. **Static Files**

Collect static files for Bootstrap, jQuery, and other front-end frameworks:

```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

### 6. **Run the Server**

You're all set! Start the development server to see PizzaLava in action:
